# Reversi game - Python project
## By Nitsan Shaked


## Reversi
**Reversi** is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board. 
* It was invented in 1883.
* Also calls Othello
* Each reversi piece has a black side and a white side. On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up. You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flipped by your pieces.
* The winner is the one who has more colored pieces when the game ends.
